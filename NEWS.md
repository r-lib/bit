# bit 4.6.0

## BUG FIXES

1. Corrected the function prototype for a C function, #36. Thanks @aitap for investigating and suggesting a fix.

1. `chunk()` works if {ff} is loaded but not attached, #3. Thanks @dschlaep for the report.

## NOTES

1. After creating, developing, and maintaining {bit} for about 16 years, Jens Oehlschl√§gel has decided to step down as maintainer of the package. As with {bit64}, Michael Chirico will take over in this duty. Thank you Jens for creating such a wonderful & important part of the R ecosystem!

  I don't have any major plans for new features, and mostly hope to keep the package running and up to date. Contributors most welcome! I am also trying to freshen up the code base to make contribution easier.

# bit 4.5.0.1
